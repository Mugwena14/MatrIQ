        { answerText: 'Chromosomal mutations', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: 'Cloning', isCorrect: false },
    ],
    explanation: 'During meiosis, the random arrangement of homologous chromosomes leads to genetic variation in gametes, enhancing diversity.',

    questionText: 'During which phase of meiosis does the nuclear membrane disappear?',
    answerOptions: [
        { answerText: 'Metaphase', isCorrect: false },

        { answerText: 'Prophase', isCorrect: true },
        { answerText: 'Anaphase', isCorrect: false },
    ],
    explanation: 'In prophase of meiosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down, allowing chromosomes to become visible and begin pairing up.',

    questionText: 'Which ONE of the following is an example of discontinuous variation in humans?',
    answerOptions: [

    questionText: 'For a particular characteristic, the offspring inherits …',
    answerOptions: [
        { answerText: 'One allele from the mother and one allele from the father.', isCorrect: true },
        { answerText: 'Both alleles from the father.', isCorrect: false },

    explanation: 'Every individual inherits one allele for each trait from each parent. These alleles may be dominant or recessive and combine to determine the offspring’s phenotype.',

{
    questionText: 'Which ONE of the following is CORRECT for speciation through geographic isolation?',
    answerOptions: [
        { answerText: 'The populations undergo phenotypic changes only.', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: 'Each population undergoes natural selection independently.', isCorrect: true },
        { answerText: 'The conditions on each side of the geographic barrier are the same.', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: 'The new species formed are genotypically the same as the original species.', isCorrect: false },
    ],
    explanation: 'Geographic isolation leads to reproductive isolation. Over time, populations adapt independently to different environments, resulting in distinct genotypes and eventual speciation.',

    questionText: 'Which ONE of the following combinations of cell division events occur in both meiosis and mitosis?',
    answerOptions: [
        { answerText: '(ii), (iii) and (iv) only', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: '(ii) and (iv) only', isCorrect: true },
        { answerText: '(i), (iii) and (iv) only', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: '(ii) and (iv) only', isCorrect: false }, 
    ],
    explanation: 'Both meiosis and mitosis involve chromatids being pulled to opposite poles and individual chromosomes lining up at the equator. Events specific to meiosis, like homologous pairing and random assortment, do not occur in mitosis.',

{
    questionText: 'How many nucleotides containing thymine (T) were present in Strand 1?',
    answerOptions: [
        { answerText: '8', isCorrect: true },
        { answerText: '4', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: '2', isCorrect: false },
        { answerText: '16', isCorrect: false },
    ],
    explanation: 'Due to base-pairing rules, strand 1 contains the same number of thymine (T) as strand 2 has adenine (A)—which is 8. Therefore, strand 1 has 8 thymine nucleotides.',
